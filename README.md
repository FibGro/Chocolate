# Chocolate Project

This project is part of Learn by Building (LBB) assignment. The project will deliver and implement some knowledge related to the usage of Rmarkdown, exploratory data analysis by using R and publishing into the Rpubs. The goal of the project :

- Discover where are cocoa beans with the highest average rating grown.
- Discover which countries manufacture chocolate bars with the highest average rating.
- Discover the relationship between a cocoa percentage in chocolate bars and its rating.
